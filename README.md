# Trivia-Game

This trivia game is composed of 5 general knowledge questions fetched from the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/). A 60 seconds timer is running to prevent players from looking up the questions. The game will end once the timer reaches 0 or the player checks its answers. A confetti surprise awaits those that get a perfect score.
